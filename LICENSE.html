<p>The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested in the Original Work: * use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage, * reproduce the Work, * modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work, * communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may be, the Work, * distribute the Work or copies thereof, * lend and rent the Work or copies thereof, * sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof. Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so. In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

<p>The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.</p>

<h2 id="id_4-limitations-on-copyright">4. Limitations on copyright<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id_4-limitations-on-copyright"></a></h2>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="id_5-obligations-of-the-licensee">5. Obligations of the Licensee<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id_5-obligations-of-the-licensee"></a></h2>
<p>The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Attribution right</strong>: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.</p>
<p><strong>Copyleft clause</strong>: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by communicating <em>EUPL v. 1.2 only</em>. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility clause</strong>: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, <em>Compatible Licence</em> refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee’s obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>Provision of Source Code</strong>: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work. Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.</p>

<p>The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or <em>bugs</em> inherent to this type of development. For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an <em>as is</em> basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

<p>Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.

<h2 id="id_9-additional-agreements">9. Additional agreements<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id_9-additional-agreements"></a></h2>
<p>While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.</p>

<p>The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="id_13-miscellaneous">13. Miscellaneous<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#id_13-miscellaneous"></a></h2>
